## Pronunciation

- With the **t**:  
  **Mot-zɛn-tai** — *“Mot”* as in *motion*, clear *t* sound, followed by *zen* and *tai* (rhymes with "tie").  
  (moht-ZEN-tie)

- Without the **t** (optional, stylistic):  
  **Mozɛn-tai** — the *t* is silent or soft, blending smoothly.  
  (mo-zen-TIE or mo-zen-tai)

Both pronunciations are acceptable and reflect different nuances of the name's identity.
